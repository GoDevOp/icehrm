**IceHrm Installed successfully, but why I'm getting a blank login page?**

Most commonly this is due to having an incorrect log path in <icehrm>/app/config.php. In this file the first line is to
define the log file path for icehrm.

```php
ini_set('error_log', '/tmp/icehrm.log');
```
Inorder to resolve this, make sure the is writable by the web server. If you are on windows you can specify a file inside 
C:\tmp folder using C:/tmp/icehrm.log.

If your issue did not get resolved by following above step then try enabling all logs. You can do this by commenting out 
first line in <icehrm>/include.common.php. Then your include.common.php should look like following.

```php
<?php
//error_reporting(0);
```
Check the error log file and you should be able to find the issue.
